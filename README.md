# TRCC initial wishlist
- Calendar UI (title, days per week)
- Show correct dates per month
- Show correct number of days per month
- Show three shifts per day (time, name)
- Ability to add your name to a shift (not remove)
- UI for email if you need to remove yourself from a shift

## Potential solutions to automate adding someone to a shift
- Drop down of counsellors
- Each counsellor given a set number of hours
- admin user who can remove names from shifts
- send email to laura if counsellor goes above their suggested number of hours?


## Initial Stories to tackle the above
1. ~~Create calendar UI (dynamic title, days per week)~~
2. ~~Ability to go through months on single page~~
3. ~~Show correct shifts per day (time, name)~~
4. ~~Responsive~~
5. Ability to add any counsellor to a shift via static dropdown list without DB connection (non-removable)
6. Add accountability hours per counsellor
7. Connect dropdown list to DB counsellor list
8. Add DB connection for filled shifts
9. Add admin user who can remove counsellors without DB connection
10. Add DB connection for removing functionality
11. Add EBU logic (admin is only one who can add them?)
12. UI for "need to remove a shift? email." flow
13. Improve styles (color palette, font sizes, etc)
